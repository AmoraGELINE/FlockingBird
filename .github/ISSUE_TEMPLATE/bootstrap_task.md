One line summary of the task. Actionable: something that someone can do. This is the title too.

> E.g. Make a foo that provides bar (and not: there should be a foo that provides a bar, which is a goal, not a task).


## Details

Concise extra details, only when the one line summary is not enough (it probably is).

## Deliverable

* Try to describe what the finished task offers.
* These are the points that someone can go through, in order to see whether the task is finished.

E.g.
* Integration tests that show how the bar is provided by the foo.
* A foo-page that shows the bar.
* A link to  the foo-page.
